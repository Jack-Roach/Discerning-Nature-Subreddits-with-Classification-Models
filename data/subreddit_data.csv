natureismetal,"Hey everyone!  Today is the release date of Marvel's next movie *Spider-Man: No Way Home*, and thus we've added pretty extensive spoiler code to our auto-mod, so we're hoping to prevent anything from being ruined for anyone who plans to and hasn't yet seen the movie.  This will be in place for one week, or until December 24 (ish).  

Of course, we can't catch everything, so we've also included another command that if anyone simply responds to such a comment with ""Spoiler"", it'll create a notification for us to check it out and take any necessary actions.  This specific code will be removed December 20(ish).  

Fun Fact: I was added to the mod team because I had noticed this and /r/NatureIsFuckingLit being overrun by spam spoiler bots for *Avengers: Endgame* and I had already seen it three times in the first 36 hours it was released, and was happy to help them out.  So, this is quite important to me.
